What ahppens when you initialize a repository?  Why do you need to do it?

	When git is initialized it creates a store to capture commit history and versions.
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?  What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area alows you to "set aside" a file that you want to commit but don't want
	to commit until you have all the files together to be completed in the single commit.  It
	also allows you to reset and remove files from the staging area if you decide additonal
	changes are required before making the commit.
